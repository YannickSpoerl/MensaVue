# MensaVue
As I am learning Vue.js at the moment, I use this little playground to get a grasp of the basics.

I am implementing a nice litte application for the university canteens and their meals with the openmensa.org API.

Planned (and some already coded) features are:
- Select city of your choice
- Select canteen of your choice
- Choose the tab with the date you wish to see
- See a list of all meals on that day with their information
- sort the meals by filter
- add canteens to your favourites
- search meals across canteens
